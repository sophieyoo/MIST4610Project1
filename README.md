Our group chose to design a database for a hospital management system that helps organize and track patient care, staff activity, and billing information. 
The goal of this database is to store and manage key information about patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, prescriptions, and financial transactions 
in a way that supports hospital operations and managerial decision-making. The database allows the hospital to record basic details about patients, insurance providers, 
and the doctors who treat them. Each doctor is assigned to a specific department, and each patient may have multiple appointments with different doctors. 
During those appointments, doctors can issue prescriptions, request lab tests, and add new entries to the patient’s medical record. Every patient is assigned to a room 
during their stay, and each visit creates a bill that is linked to their insurance provider. The billing information helps hospital management track outstanding payments 
and monitor total revenue. This data model captures the essential operational data of a hospital and supports queries that managers may use to make better decisions—such 
as identifying the most frequently visited departments, tracking doctor workloads, monitoring patient admissions, and reviewing financial performance.

Our data model represents how a real hospital functions day to day, capturing the connections between patients, doctors, departments, and the many services that keep a 
hospital running smoothly. At the core of the model is the Patient entity, since nearly every process in the hospital revolves around the patient. Each patient can have 
multiple medical records that track their diagnoses and treatments, and they can also make many appointments with different doctors. Because an appointment depends on 
both the patient and the doctor, it forms a many-to-many relationship, showing how patients and doctors interact throughout the care process. Every appointment results 
in one Bill, which records the cost and payment details, and since each patient’s bill is tied to their insurance provider, there’s a one-to-many relationship between 
Insurance and Patient, showing that one insurance plan can cover multiple individuals.Doctors are organized within Departments such as Cardiology, Pediatrics, or Neurology. 
A department can have many doctors, and each doctor belongs to one department, forming a one-to-many relationship. Within this, some doctors may supervise others, creating a 
recursive relationship that reflects real hospital hierarchies. Each department also has one designated department head, connecting a one-to-one relationship between Department 
and Doctor. Departments are also responsible for multiple Rooms, which represent hospital spaces where patients stay during treatment. Because one room can host several patients 
over time, this creates a one-to-many relationship between Room and Patient. Beyond daily appointments, doctors can issue Prescriptions or order Lab Tests for their patients. 
These depend on both the patient and doctor, forming many-to-many relationships, since multiple patients can receive prescriptions or lab tests from multiple doctors. 
Altogether, this model mirrors the complex but organized structure of a hospital—how patients move through departments, meet with doctors, receive treatments, get billed, and 
stay in rooms. By capturing all these interactions, the data model helps ensure that every piece of information works together to support efficient and effective patient care.
